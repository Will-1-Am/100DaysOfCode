# 100DaysOfCode
My new repo
Friday, 12 October 2018
I am officially starting #100DaysOfCode after investing 200 practical hours studying for Amazon Web Services Certified Architect exams with ACloudGuru, currently engaged in iOS Devolpment training with London App Brewery, and have taken on the freeCodeCamp.org challenges.  Then I found out about Mr Kallaway and thought what a great idea!  So, let's make this even more official.


### R1Day002 Saturday, 13 October 2018
It is Saturday and #100DaysOfCode round 1 day 2 starts (only 98 to go)!  Time to tackle the #freeCodeCamp Survey Form Challenge, have a look at my Chat View Controller with @yu_angela and the #LondonAppBrewery.

TextWrangler is awesome and has been replaced by @bbedit 12.  Thank you @KroonenburgRyan for introducing me to this awesome tool.

Ok, so finally the Survey Form Challenge is nearly complete with the submit button needing a tidy. Considering that I managed to stay out of the dog house by getting some chores done, it was a productive day.

### R1Day003 Sunday, 14 October 2018

#100DaysOfCode R1Day3 has begun with a great read of Michael Abelar's book entitled “HTML for Novices by Novices”.  A very easy read if you are familiar with #html5 and even if you are not!  #freeCodeCamp

### R1Day004 Monday, 15 October 2018
#100DaysOfCode R1Day4 has begun with answering questions about iOS coding and the Flash Chat app @udemy & @LondonAppBrewer. Now its over to  #freeCodeCamp and tidy my Survey Form project for my portfolio.

While optimising my #html5 for aesthetics, I needed a way to "see" where my elements started and finished.  Intuition led me to set the "border" attribute in css for the element(s) in question - so simple and so illuminating.  When you are finished you just delete the attributes.

A great little article "All about floats" https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/ … helped to clarify the use of this wonderful attribute.  #freeCodeCamp  And now my button isn't bounding all over the shop...

### R1Day005 Tuesday, 16 October 2018

“specificity” - The CSS block with the most specific selector reigns when more than one CSS block selects the same element, and all try to set the same property.  Thank you, @pauldwaite! see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11529495/importance-of-css-stylesheet-hierarchy

Submitted Survey Form project #freeCodeCamp https://codepen.io/will-1-am-the-Iceman/full/ePZVKE … #100DaysofCode

Finished R1Day5 with a bit of Swift coding an animation and tap gestures with @LondonAppBrewer #100DaysOfCode 

Need to review how to construct Swift Closures.

### R1Day006 Wednesday, 17 October 2018
R1 Day 6 in full-swing. I totally underestimated the coolness of CSS and expect I have much more to discover check this out https://medium.com/9elements/css-border-radius-can-do-that-d46df1d013ae - thank you @tom_raley! #100DaysOfCode.  And there is this little tool... https://9elements.github.io/fancy-border-radius/#57.31.82.64--395.395

Also a very entertaining, and enlightening, read I discovered courtesy of @yu_angela - Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous by Michael Hartl. @LondonAppBrewer https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial#aside-technical_sophistication

Working on the Flash Chat project @LondonAppBrewer which uses @Firebase - another great tool... It is important to remember to change your read/write permissions and publish the changes for testing... #100DaysOfCode

Flash Chat project completed @LondonAppBrewer.  Looking forward to lecture 201! #100DaysOfCode

### R1Day007 Thursday, 18 October 2018
What better way to start R1 Day 7 than to register for Hacktoberfest 2018?! https://medium.freecodecamp.org/hacktoberfest-2018-how-you-can-get-your-free-shirt-even-if-youre-new-to-coding-96080dd0b01b  #100DaysOfCode @github @digitalocean #freeCodeCamp

https://codeweek.eu/

The issue with the Flash Chat project and the ChameleonFramework could be related to an installation corruption issue as a fellow student pointed out that a color reference has been renamed in the latest version of ChameleonFramework.  Will look at reinstalling the pod.

Now "Enumeration value 'kCGColorSpaceModelXYZ' not handled in switch" but this is not affecting the Flash Chat App for now.

### R1Day008 Friday, 19 October 2018
Day 8 begins with getting more familiar with git.  The @LondonAppBrewer y's "Git, GitHub and Version Control" module is presented really well.  Check it out if you're into that sort of thing. #100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

Git has got a new fan!  Browser, CLI and Xcode gitting is awesome.  Thank you @yu_angela & #LondonAppBrewer.  #100DaysOfCode

### R1Day009 Saturday, 20 October 2018
Just in case you thought I was slackin', it is R1 Day 9 and I have been at it, hopefully fulfilling some of my  #Hacktoberfest2018 obligations by submitting my first ever real PR by doing some writing for MailHog https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog !  #freeCodeCamp #100DaysOfCode  

### R1Day010 Sunday, 21 October 2018
R1 Day 10 Spent part of the day trying to implement the front camera in an iOS app.  #100DaysOfCode

One of the first issues with my new camera app was reported with the followng message.
"uncaught exception 'NSUnknownKeyException', reason: '[<xxxxx.ViewController 0x13bd0ba60> setValue:forUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key cameraOut.'"
Resolved by updating  the name of the imageView in Connections inspector.  

The following error in my camera app needs to be looked.
"Reading from public effective user settings."  - I suspect this is something to due with getting permission to use the camera.

### R1Day011 Monday, 22 October 2018
R1 Day 11 Another day of golden opportunity begins with finding a resolution for the error in my new Swift app - "Reading from public effective user settings." #100DaysOfCode #LondonAppBrewer

First camera app now working! Thank you @brianadventcode for your awesome tutorials - and some tweeking... @LondonAppBrewer #100DaysOfCode

Learned that it can help to specify the data type of a constant when it is an optional in Swift.

Finished Day 11 with a shabang and a rewrite of an article about Bash in support of #Hacktoberfest2018 #100DaysOfCode  Roll on day 12.

### R1Day012 Monday, 23 October 2018
Time to make a start on my third #freeCodeCamp project on this the 12th day of 
#100DaysOfCode R1.

Flavio Copes has a great blog and I found this piece on HTTP Status Codes https://flaviocopes.com/http-status-codes/

Had a look at Brian Advent's website https://www.brianadvent.com/ which looks very interesting for iOS development.

Found a piece on #pragma mark on stackoverflow.com https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35963128/swift-understanding-mark

"The // MARK: and // MARK: - syntax in Swift functions identically to the #pragma mark and #pragma mark - syntax in Objective-C.

When using this syntax (plus // TODO: and // FIXME:), you can get some extra information to show up in the quick jump bar."
