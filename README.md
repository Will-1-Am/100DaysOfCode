# 100DaysOfCode
My new repo

I am officially starting #100DaysOfCode after investing 200 practical hours studying for Amazon Web Services Certified Architect exams with ACloudGuru, currently engaged in iOS Devolpment training with London App Brewery, and have taken on the freeCodeCamp.org challenges.  Then I found out about Mr Kallaway and thought what a great idea!  So, let's make this even more official.


### R1Day2
It is Saturday and #100DaysOfCode round 1 day 2 starts (only 98 to go)!  Time to tackle the #freeCodeCamp Survey Form Challenge, have a look at my Chat View Controller with @yu_angela and the #LondonAppBrewery.

TextWrangler is awesome and has been replaced by @bbedit 12.  Thank you @KroonenburgRyan for introducing me to this awesome tool.

Ok, so finally the Survey Form Challenge is nearly complete with the submit button needing a tidy. Considering that I managed to stay out of the dog house by getting some chores done, it was a productive day.

### R1Day3

#100DaysOfCode R1Day3 has begun with a great read of Michael Abelar's book entitled “HTML for Novices by Novices”.  A very easy read if you are familiar with #html5 and even if you are not!  #freeCodeCamp

### R1Day4
#100DaysOfCode R1Day4 has begun with answering questions about iOS coding and the Flash Chat app @udemy & @LondonAppBrewer. Now its over to  #freeCodeCamp and tidy my Survey Form project for my portfolio.

While optimising my #html5 for aesthetics, I needed a way to "see" where my elements started and finished.  Intuition led me to set the "border" attribute in css for the element(s) in question - so simple and so illuminating.  When you are finished you just delete the attributes.

A great little article "All about floats" https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/ … helped to clarify the use of this wonderful attribute.  #freeCodeCamp  And now my button isn't bounding all over the shop...

### R1Day5

“specificity” - The CSS block with the most specific selector reigns when more than one CSS block selects the same element, and all try to set the same property.  Thank you, @pauldwaite! see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11529495/importance-of-css-stylesheet-hierarchy

Finished R1Day5 with a bit of Swift coding an animation and tap gestures with @LondonAppBrewer #100DaysOfCode 

Need to review how to construct Swift Closures.
